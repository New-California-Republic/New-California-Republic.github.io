# New California Republic
New California Republic is a fictional alliance in the game [Politics & War](https://politicsandwar.com/) based on the faction from [Fallout](https://fallout.bethesda.net/). We are one of the final bastions of civilization in this nuclear wasteland.
We focus on safety and stability, but we have no qualms about involving ourselves in conflict.
